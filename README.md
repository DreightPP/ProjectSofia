# Project Sofia - Open Source TKL Keyboard.

 ## --Work in progress--
 
 Project Sofia is a fully open souce TKL keyboard project based on [ojthetiny/OpenTKL](https://github.com/ojthetiny/OpenTKL)
 
 The original project was really great, i made some changes to be able to create a more unique product and an even more "custom" keyboard.

Important Info (READ BEFORE ORDERING):
- I do not offer any sort of warranty for this, nor can I be held liable if something goes wrong.
- Renders are not fully representative of the final product.
- Please, PLEASE look over the design before you do anything with it, it's possible and very likely that there are some errors, I'm just a human.
